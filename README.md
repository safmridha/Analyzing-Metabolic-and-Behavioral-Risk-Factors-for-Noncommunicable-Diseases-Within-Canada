A summary of the project: 

The premise of this study was to analyze the effects that behaviour and metablolic risk factors have on causing the onset of Non-Communicable Disease within Canada. 7 Datasets from the WHO were merged via
SQL to invesigate this overarching research question. 

Non-Communicable Diseases refer to illnesses that cannot be transmitted from one person to another. The Non-Communicable Diseases considered in this study were: Cardiovascular diseases, Diabetes Mellitus,
Respiratory Diseases and Malignant Neoplasms (Cancer).

Metabolic risk factors are typically physiological conditions, that can be highly influenced by genetics. The metabolic risk factors considered in this study included: Cholesterol levels, Hypertension, and Obesity. 

Behavioural risk factors are typically lifestyle behaviours that are typically controllable. The behavioural risk factors considered included: Physical Inactivity, Tobacco use, and Alcohol consumption. 

The ipynb file contains the python codes that were used for data wrangling and the creation of visualizations. 
SQL was also heavily utilized in this assignment to answer the guiding questions; the servers were connected via python, so the ipynb files will also contain the queries used to obtain outputs. 


Findings: 

Tobacco use, Obesity, Alcohol Consumption and Physical Inactivity play a significant role in predicting Respiratory Disease mortalities; 
Tobacco use, Obesity, Cholesterol, Physical Inactivity and Hypertension significantly predict Cardiovascular disease mortalities; 
Tobacco use, Obesity, Alcohol and Cholesterol have a significant role in projecting Diabetes Mellitus-caused mortalities; 
Obesity, Alcohol use, Cholesterol, Physical Inactivity and Hypertension are significant variables in projecting Malignant Neoplasm-caused deaths.
